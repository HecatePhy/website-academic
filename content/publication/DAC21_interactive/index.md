abstract: Analog layout design still relies heavily on manual efforts. Current fully automated flows are not yet able to satisfy the demands of versatile customization and not compatible to the existing manual flows. Interactive layout editing has the potential to bridge the gap between the manual flows and fully automated flows shooting for both performance and productivity. In this paper, we propose an interactive editing framework with instructions for both topological editing and detailed customization. We also propose an effective instant legalization algorithm for fast layout update during the real-time interaction with users.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
