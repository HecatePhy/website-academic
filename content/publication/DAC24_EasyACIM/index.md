abstract: Analog Computing-in-Memory (ACIM) is an emerging architecture to perform efficient AI edge computing. However, current ACIM designs usually have unscalable topology and still heavily rely on manual efforts. These drawbacks limit the ACIM application scenarios and lead to an un-desired time-to-market. This work proposes an end-to-end automated ACIM based on a synthesizable architecture (EasyACIM). With a given array size and customized cell library, EasyACIM can generate layouts for ACIMs with various design specifications end-to-end automatically. Leveraging the multi-objective genetic algorithm (MOGA)-based design space explorer, EasyACIM can obtain high-quality ACIM solutions based on the proposed synthesizable architecture, targeting versatile application scenarios. The ACIM solutions given by EasyACIM have a wide design space and competitive performance compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) ACIMs.
