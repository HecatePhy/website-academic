abstract = {Modern large-scale designs make extensive use of heterogeneous macros, which can significantly affect routability. Predicting the final routing quality in the early macro placement stage can filter out poor solutions and speed up design closure. By observing that routing is correlated with the relative positions between instances, we propose MacroRank, a macro placement ranking framework leveraging translation equivariance and a Learning to Rank technique. The framework is able to learn the relative order of macro placement solutions and rank them based on routing quality metrics like wirelength, number of vias, and number of shorts. The experimental results show that compared with the most recent baseline, our framework can improve the Kendall rank correlation coefficient by 49.5% and the average performance of top-30 prediction by 8.1%, 2.3%, and 10.6% on wirelength, vias, and shorts, respectively.},
