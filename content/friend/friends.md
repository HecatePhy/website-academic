[Xu](https://witty-me.github.io/) and [CK](https://www.chengke.wang/) are friends from a group next door.
Xu is always willing to share the latest progress in his field.
Also he is very popular for his generosity and humor (he provides a steady stream of coffee and snacks).
Please check his work in *wireless communication* and *wireless sensing*!
CK is good at system things, and I think he is the King of Internship.
He is an awesome researcher in computer network.
